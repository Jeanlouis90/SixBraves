        <h2>Fremy Speedraw</h2>
        
        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION
        -->
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Fremy has the appearance of a frail girl with white skin and light white hair, an eye patch covering her right eye, a leather cape as well as leather clothes, and a black cloth with a blue<br>
             flower covering her forehead. Her left eye is almost transparent blue and her glare is cold and distrustful. Her eye patch is there to hide the unnatural color of her right eye, and the cloth<br>
             hides the scar left by the broken horn on her forehead
        <p>
            
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        
        <!--
            ALSO MADE WITH <3 AND MISO SOUP
        -->
        
        <p>
           Fremy is the Saint of Gunpowder. Her unique heredity allowed her to receive from the god a type of power that no one ever received before her, as "Gunpowder" isn't among the 78<br>
            officially known types of Saints. As such, she's also the only Saint who isn't under the supervision of Mora. Her power allows her to freely create explosives during battles, and greatly<br>
            increases the damage caused by her gun's bullets.<br><br>
            In the world, guns aren't powerful enough to injure a kyouma, but in Fremy's case, she can easily kill most of the kyouma as well as most armored humans in a single shot.<br>
            One drawback however, is that Fremy's gun needs to be reloaded after only firing a single shot which leaves her weak in close combat or when surrounded by multiple opponents.<br>
            Adlet was also able to overcome the disadvantage between them by getting close enough to duck underneath the long barrel of her gun, revealing the weakness of not only the barrel of her gun in close-quarters,<br>
            but being stranded without anything to use as ammo.
