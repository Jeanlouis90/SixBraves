           Mora's power of the Mountain is very versatile, and  is composed of several different powers. Some of them can only be used if she is on a mountain.<br><br>

            <strong>Enhanced Strength:</strong> Mora can greatly increase her strength.<br><br>

            <strong>Long Range Communication:</strong> Mora can make her voice resonate clearly to people far away.<br><br>

            <strong>Enhanced Vision:</strong> If Mora is on a mountain she can use her power to gain vision of any location on the mountain.<br><br>

            <strong>Healing:</strong> Mora can heal injuries, though not as good as Rolonia or Toulo.
