        <h2>Hans Humpty</h2>
        
        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION
        -->
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Hans has long disheveled hair that covers his eyes. His clothes are simple and patched-up. His appearance is also reminiscent to that of a cat, with his cat-like broad smile as well as his movements and actions. He also has a tail. His speech pattern in Japanese is very distinctive, being a mix of Tohoku dialect and cat speech. His speech pattern was also inspired by cats, as he based his fighting style on the way cat moves, he does it out of respect.

        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        
        <!--
            ALSO MADE WITH <3 AND MISO SOUP
        -->
        
        <p>
           In battle, Hans wields two wide blade knives and moves around in an inhuman and completely unpredictable manner, sometimes rotating midair, sometimes temporarily walking on his fists, displaying at all times the flexibility of a cat. He's fast, silent, and deadly in all situations. He is extremely capable, holding his own against Adlet Mayer.
