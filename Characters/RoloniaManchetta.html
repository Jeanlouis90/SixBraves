        <h2>Rolonia Manchetta</h2>
        
        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION
        -->
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Rolonia is a short girl wearing heavy cow-themed armor and glasses.  
        <p>
            
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        
        <!--
            ALSO MADE WITH <3 AND MISO SOUP
        -->
        
        <p>
           Rolonia has the ability to control blood. This power can be used to quickly heal a person by improving the natural healing properties of blood, or to obtain information of their body by tasting their blood (species, age, abilities, health, etc).<br><br>

           She is also able to control objects that have been covered in her blood, like the whip she uses to fight. This allows her to control the whip's movements. This whip can also suck the blood out of an opponent if it touches their skin, meaning a single hit is enough to defeat a human oponent.<br><br>

           She was also able to use her blood ability to resurrect a dead person by cleaning the spilled blood and forcing it back into his body, however she is unable to heal more serious injuries like broken bones.<br><br>
