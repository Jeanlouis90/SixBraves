        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Nashetania has long flaxen hair, big red eyes, plump lips and a charming pale face. She gives an impression of nobility by just standing still. In battle, she wears white armor with a headgear featuring two fake rabbit ears, and wields a rapier with a jewel mounted on the grip. When Nashetania first visited Adlet in the prison she wore a maid's outfit. In the Wailing Demon Territory she wears a black rabbit themed armor.<br><br>
             As of volume 3, she is missing her left arm.

            ALSO MADE WITH <3 AND MISO SOUP

        <p>
            Nashetania became the Saint of Blades three years before the beginning of the series which allows her to create multiple blades wherever she wants with her rapier. She can use them offensively as projectiles, or raise them from the ground to impale her opponents. She can also use the blades defensively by forming a shield around her. Nashetania is one of the most promising battle-oriented Saints and as such, she has received training regularly from Mora after inheriting her power. <br><br>

            Nashetania also has several abilities gained from being fused with Kyouma. She has a concealing ability and rapid self-healing. She also produced a Sacred Instrument, a Blade Gem, an ability that she kept hidden from the other Saints.
