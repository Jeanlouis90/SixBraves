            MADE WITH <3 AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION

        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Chamo is a frail-looking girl wearing a green dress with frills, with the inside having a red and black checkered-pattern, and a matching buffoon hat. She has white shorts and red and black shoes. She is usually seen with a green foxtail in her hand.

        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        
        <!--
            ALSO MADE WITH <3 AND MISO SOUP
        -->
        
        <p>
           Chamo received her power around seven years ago. As the Saint of the Swamp, her power allows her to use her stomach as a swamp, creating a place for her minions to live in. She doesn't eat normally, and instead eats any animal or Kyouma interesting her. She then uses the components eaten to either create new Jyumas, which she calls "pets" or to alter/reinforce the pets that she has already tamed.<br><br>

         Her pets range from creatures as small as mice to creatures bigger than a human, who all live in her stomach, where she can freely heal and alter them. When she needs to summon them, she use her green foxtail to make herself vomit the ones that she needed. Her pets are completely loyal to her, will act of their own will to protect her even by sacrificing themselves, can regenerate in a few seconds from most lethal wounds.<br><br>

         Chamo has a lot of affection for her pets, and will get angry at anyone who injures them. She can summon more than 70 Jyumas at the same time. Not all of them are combat oriented, as small ones are used as reconnaissance units over and under ground. Since her Jyumas are technically aquatic life forms, they are especially vulnerable to fire and extreme heat.<br><br>

         Chamo's power is on a completely different level than the other heroes. Among other feats of strength, Chamo participated in a tournament several years ago. She made a mistake in controlling her power and accidentally killed her opponent in the first round. Seeing Chamo's power, every singe other contestants immediately resigned from the tournament, which therefore ended with Chamo's win by default. When she's asked by Mora to help with the training of other Saints, the battle are usually organized so that Chamo has to fight alone against several strong Saints as the same time. Even under such circumstances, Chamo has to restrain her power in order to not kill her opponents.<br><br>
