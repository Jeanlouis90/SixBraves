        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
             Goldof is tall, with black hair and is always seen with a stern look on his face. He wears heavy and extremely resistant black armor with dark green accents and wields a heavy spear in battle.<br>
             His helmet has two curved horns mimicking a sheep's horns, and his spear is linked to his gauntlet by an heavy chain used like a lanyard.

            Goldof is a genius fighter, blessed with almost supernatural strength and speed as well as with a resilient and huge body. He is said to be the strongest person in Piena. Nashetania claims he would have won Piena's martial arts tournament the previous year against her if he didn't go easy on her. Goldof is one of the best fighters among the heroes of the six flowers, and becomes even stronger when his princess is in danger.
